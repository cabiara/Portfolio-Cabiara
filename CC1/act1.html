          <h2>Prefix: + X Y</h2>

          <p>Operators are written before their operands. The expressions given above are equivalent to / * A + B C D</p>

          <p>As for Postfix, operators are evaluated left-to-right and brackets are superfluous. Operators act on the two nearest values on the right. I have again added (totally unnecessary) brackets to make this clear:
            <br><br>
          (/ (* A (+ B C) ) D)</p>

          <p>Although Prefix "operators are evaluated left-to-right", they use values to their right, and if these values themselves involve computations then this changes the order that the operators have to be evaluated in.</p>

          <p>Because Postfix operators use values to their left, any values involving computations will already have been calculated as we go left-to-right, and so the order of evaluation of the operators is not disrupted in the same way as in Prefix expressions.</p>

          <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
          <p>+ * A B / C D<br>
          / * A + B C D<br>
          * A + B / C D</p>

          <h2>Infix: X + Y</h2>

          <p>Operators are written in-between their operands. This is the usual way we write expressions. An expression such as A * ( B + C ) / D is usually taken to mean something like: "First add B and C together, then multiply the result by A, then divide by D to give the final answer."</p>

          <p>Infix notation needs extra information to make the order of evaluation of the operators clear: rules built into the language about operator precedence and associativity, and brackets ( ) to allow users to override these rules. For example, the usual rules for associativity say that we perform operations from left to right, so the multiplication by A is assumed to come before the division by D. Similarly, the usual rules for precedence say that we perform multiplication and division before we perform addition and subtraction.</p>

          <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
          <p>A * B + C / D<br>
            A * (B + C) / D<br>
            A * (B + C / D)</p>
          
          <h2>Postfix: X Y +</h2>
          <p>Operators are written after their operands. The infix expression given above is equivalent to A B C + * D /
          </p>
          <p>The order of evaluation of operators is always left-to-right, and brackets cannot be used to change this order. Because the "+" is to the left of the "*" in the example above, the addition must be performed before the multiplication. 
          </p>
          <p>Operators act on values immediately to the left of them. For example, the "+" above uses the "B" and "C". We can add (totally unnecessary) brackets to make this explicit: 
            <br><br>
          ( (A (B C +) *) D /) 
          
          <p>Thus, the "*" uses the two values immediately preceding: "A", and the result of the addition. Similarly, the "/" uses the result of the multiplication and the "D".
          </p>

          <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
          <p>A B * C D / +<br>
            A B C + * D /<br>
            A B C D / + *</p>
